A Rapid Development Framework for WordPress.

== Description ==

**CURRENTLY IN BETA**

Piklist is the developers best friend. A rapid development framework for WordPress that will let you concentrate on the main focus of your plugin or theme, and let Piklist handle everything else.

**Piklist makes it easy to:**

*   Build Fields for Settings page, Widgets and Custom Post Types with minimal code (Custom Taxonomies and User Profiles coming soon.)
*   Conditionally show fields (or their values), based on Post Status and/or User Role.
*   Define Custom Post Statuses
*   Relate Post-to-Posts.
*   <a href="http://piklist.com">and more...</a>

**COMING SOON**

*   Drag-and-drop Field and Form builder.
*   Out-of-the-box applications: Contact Manager, Order Management, etc.

**Better Custom Post Types**

*   Powerful Custom Post Types 
*   Relate Custom Post Types to each other. 
*   Add your own post statuses. 

**Codeless Meta Boxes**

*   Group fields in a meta box, by placing them all in one file.
*   Add a comment block at the top of your file to define the meta box attributes 
*   Hide/Show based on the post status. 
*   Hide/Show based on the users capability. 
*   Sort meta boxes with granular control. 
*   Lock the box, so users cannot move or hide them. 

**Simple, Groupable Widgets**

*   Group widgets into one widget to save space, and make finding them easier 
*   Create one file for your Widget settings, and one for your output... all done!
*   Use any Piklist field type in your widget settings page.

**Powerful Fields**

*   Backend, Frontend, Widgets... it all works the same.

**Lots of field types (and more coming soon!):**

*   text
*   textarea
*   checkbox
*   radio
*   select
*   post editor
*   hidden
*   html
*   date chooser 
*   color picker
*   add more


**Choose a content type for your field (You can even mix-n-match on one form)**

*   post
*   post_meta
*   comment
*   comment_meta
*   taxonomy
*   taxonomy_meta
*   user
*   user_meta

**Mix Field and Content types (i.e. Taxonomies as radio buttons)**

*   Hide/Show based on another form field. 
*   Hide/Show based on the post status.
*   Hide/Show based on the users capability.
*   Hide form fields, and just show field values
